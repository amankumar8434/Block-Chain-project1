# DonationPlatform Smart Contract

## Vision

The **DonationPlatform** smart contract enables users to seamlessly integrate charitable donations into their transactions. By setting a donation percentage, users can automatically donate a portion of each transaction to a specified charity, promoting a culture of giving in a decentralized manner.

## Features

- **Set Donation Percentage and Charity**:
  - Users can specify a percentage of their transactions to be donated and designate a charity to receive the donations.
- **Automatic Donation**:
  - A portion of each transaction is automatically transferred to the charity, while the remainder is sent to the recipient.

## Future Scope

1. **Donation Tracking**:

   - Implement donation tracking for users to monitor how much they've contributed over time.

2. **Multi-Charity Support**:

   - Allow users to split donations across multiple charities or change their selected charity dynamically.

3. **Donation Reward System**:
   - Introduce a reward system for donors, providing recognition or incentives for consistent contributions.

The **DonationPlatform** contract simplifies the process of charitable giving by automating donations, ensuring transparency and convenience for users who want to support causes while conducting their regular transactions.
